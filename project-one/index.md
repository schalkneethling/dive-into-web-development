# Assignment: Build Your First “About Me” Page

## Goal
Create a simple web page that introduces yourself (or a made-up persona).  
This project will help you practice structuring content with **semantic HTML** and styling it with **CSS**.

---

## Requirements

### Content (HTML)
- A main heading with your name.  
- One or two short paragraphs about yourself (background, interests, or goals).  
- An image (this could be you, a pet, or even a placeholder).  
- A short list of your favorite things (foods, movies, hobbies, etc.).  

### Styling (CSS)
- Set background and text colors.  
- Choose and apply a font (you can use system fonts or try loading a font from Google Fonts).  
- Add spacing so the page feels comfortable to read (margin and padding).  

---

## Stretch Goal (Challenge)
Make your page **responsive** so that it looks good on both large screens and small ones.  
Specifically:  
- Ensure the image resizes properly for smaller screens (`max-width: 100%; height: auto;`).  
- Add one media query (e.g., for screen widths below 600px) that changes something about the layout or typography.  
  - Examples: adjust font sizes, change background color, or re-arrange content.  

This will likely push you to look up how media queries work and how to think about mobile design.
